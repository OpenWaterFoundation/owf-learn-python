# Python Language / Python Programming Basics #

The Python language provides features common to many languages and allows add-on modules to be written to provide more specific functionality.
Python 2 was used for many years and is still in use.  Python 3 is newer and is being phased in as developers update their code.

## Program Files and Modules ##

Python program files have the file extension .py.
Python files correspond to modules that can have a hierarchical package naming convention.
Python files can include built-in Python language and calls to built-in modules, and can also call add-on modules.
