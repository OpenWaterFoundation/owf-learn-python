## Introduction ##

The Qt package is a powerful software library for creating graphical user interfaces.
Qt is written in C++, with bindings for Python, which means that most functions and features in the C++
have similar names in Python, accounting for typical language differences.
The Python version of Qt is referred to as PyQt.
Qt version 5 (Qt5) is used for example code.
