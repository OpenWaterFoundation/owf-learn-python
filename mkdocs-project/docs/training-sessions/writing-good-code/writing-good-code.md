## Introduction ##

This session provides guidance for writing "good Python code".
Many of these topics are common to all programming languages.
The definition of "good code" is subject to some interpretation,
and this documentation attempts to provide general guidance as well as presenting contrasting opinions where appropriate.
It is generally better to follow common sense and recognized standards where possible
than to argue without compromise about programming.

Python has its own "pythonic" way of programming that in some cases is similar to other
languages and in other cases is quite different.
Standard Python guidelines such as the
[PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
should be followed where possible.

Other lessons learned from multiple programming languages provide guidance for good code.
