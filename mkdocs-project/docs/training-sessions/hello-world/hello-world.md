| See below: [Create and Run Program](#create-and-run-program) | Create and run simple "Hello World" program. |
| [Language - Main Program](../../lang/main-program/main-program.md) | More information about main program function. |

## Create and Run Program ##

Use a Python code editor to create a file (e.g., `hello-world.py`) in workspace files.
The Python code should be similar to the following simple program:

```python
# Hello World program

print("Hello World")
```

Run the program by opening a command line tool and then running the following using an appropriate Python interpreter
for the system:

```
python hello-world.py
Hello World
```
