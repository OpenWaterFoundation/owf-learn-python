## Introduction ##

Software can be written using various design approaches, typically:

* **Procedural Design** - uses functions run in a sequence, with global data and data passed between functions
	+ See:  [Wikipedia "Procedural programming"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming)
* **Object-oriented Design** - uses classes that encapsulate data and functions (methods) into objects
	+ See:  [Wikipedia "Object-oriented programming"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)

Basic programs may be sufficiently implemented using a procedural approach.
However, an object-oriented approach provides many benefits,
especially for large complex programs.

This documentation provides guidance on implementing object-oriented Python code.

The primary language building-block for object-oriented programs are classes.
See the [Classes lesson](../../lang/classes/classes.md).
