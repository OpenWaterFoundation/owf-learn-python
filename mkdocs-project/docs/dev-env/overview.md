# Python / Development Environment / Overview #

The Python development environment typically consists of the following tools,
which are described in separate pages.
The tools are listed in typical order of installation.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are useful but not required.
A development team for a software project may define which tools are preferred or required.
