The Python development environment typically consists of the following components,
which are described in separate pages:

* [Python](python/python) - software that runs a Python language interpreter
* Integrated development environment (IDE)
	+ [Eclipse PyDev](ide-eclipse/ide-eclipse)
	+ [IDLE](ide-idel/ide-idle)
	+ [PyCharm](ide-pycharm/ide-pycharm)
	+ Alternatively, a text editor can be used (see [OWF / Learn Text Editors](http://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/owf-learn-text-editors/))
* Version control software
	+ Git is the focus of examples in this documentation
* Testing framework
	+ [pytest](pytest/pytest)
