# Development Task / Creating a Virtual Environment

Virtual environments are a newer approach that install Python packages
into a virtual environment folder so that the installation of add-on Python packages does not
impact Python installations on the computer.

See:

* [Creating Virtual Environments](https://packaging.python.org/installing/#creating-virtual-environments)

Additional information will be added later.
