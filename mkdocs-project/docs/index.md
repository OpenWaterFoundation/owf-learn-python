# Open Water Foundation Learn Python Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of important Python concepts, with best practices
and working examples.  The documentation has been created by the Open Water Foundation to facilitate our
work and is being made available in the hopes taht it also helps others.

If you are reading this documentation, you have likely already decided that Python is the language that
you want to use for programming.  It is assumed that you have a basic understanding of programming and
the Python language.  There are other sources of information about Python.  This documentation focuses
on practical issues that, if handled well, will minimize frustration and increase the efficiency of
your software development.

**This documentation is a work in progress and will contain notes for inserts for awhile until time can
be devoted to filling in blanks.**

## Documentation Organization

The documentation is organized in the order of basic concepts and steps needed to build a Python program.
As time allows, additional sections will be added for more advanced topics such as use of useful Python
API libraries for water resources.
