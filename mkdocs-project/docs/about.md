# About

## Open Water Foundation

The Open Water Foundation ([openwaterfoundation.org](http://openwaterfoundation.org)) is a social enterprise
501(c)3 nonprofit that focuses on developing and supporting open source software to make better
decisions about water resources.  We have developed training modules for staff, including student interns,
in order to streamline education about technologies and software development tools.  We make these
materials available to the public to facilitate learning by others, including STEM educators and students.
Contents of training modules will be improved over time based on feedback from use.

## OWF Learn Python

The OWF Learn Python materials focus on core concepts that are important to developing robust Python software
for water resources problems.  These materials will be enhanced over time to reflect a greater breadth and depth
